# Eat Evolution App

A prototype app, working on iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, created using **Appcelerator Titanium**. It's based on Appcelerator's demo app [corporate-directory](https://github.com/appcelerator-se/corporate-directory).

In this first release it was supposed to work as a *server-less* app, because data were published as a json file in a Dropbox folder. More info inside the `data` folder.

The project was quite simple and died in cradle, but it could be a good starting point for something else.
